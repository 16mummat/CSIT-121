  <h3><u> Cook's Note </u></h3>
     <p> For a little more convenience, use chicken left over from another project or buy a rotissiere chicken and shred the meat for the pasta </p><br>
     <h3><u> Why is this my favorite recipe? </u></h3>
     
     <p>I have been cooking pasta dishes ever since I learned how to cook because pasta is one of the easiest things to cook. Boiling water and throwing in pasta for a couple of minutes can not get any easier for intro level dishes. This particular recipe is extremely easy for most people because of the ability to sub different things for premade food or additives. For example, if you are not confident cooking chicken, you can easily buy premade chicken from the store and have the same end result. I always suggest to my friends to start off with simple recipes like this one when they first start cooking for themselves. <p><br>
